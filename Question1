To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

Input Format
A single line of text denoting input string (the variable whose contents must be printed).

Output Format
Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of input string  on the second line.

SOLUTION:

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
